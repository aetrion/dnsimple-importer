This library provides import tools to import domains into DNSimple.

Before you start, put your credentials in ~/.dnsimple. For example:

    username: your_username
    password: your_password

To run:

    bundle install
    bundle exec bin/import_zone zonefile [zonefile zonefile ...]

Each of your zone files should be named with the domain name plus the .db or .txt extension. For example:

    example.com.db

When you run the importer it will create the domain in your DNSimple account if necessary. It will then import your records from the zonefiles.

The zone importer handles the following record types:

A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, PTR, NAPTR, SRV, TXT

It will not handle URL forwarding records - you'll need to set those up by hand.
