This library provides import tools to import domains into DNSimple.

Before you start, put your credentials in ~/.dnsimple. For example:

    username: your_username
    password: your_password

To run:

    bundle install
    bundle exec bin/import zonefile [zonefile zonefile ...]

At this moment nothing useful happens.
